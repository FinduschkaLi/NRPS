## Features

The Network Reduced Power System (NRPS) Model is a powerful tool for modeling electric grids of (virtual) synchronous machines. This repository contains files for running the Nonlinear Kuramoto, the NRPS model, the Friction Enhanced Power System (FEPS) model, the Reactive Active Power Power System (RAPS) model.

## Getting started

To use the NRPS Model MATLAB code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/FinduschkaLi/NRPS.git`
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the file `example_NRPS.m` to see an example of how to use the models.

## Files

### Parameterization

- **reduceNetwork.m:** File used for generating the reduced admittance matrix YRED. Input is an array of tie-line impedances and an array of loads aswell as the number of generators.
- **generateNRPSParameters.m:** File used for generating the matrices A, PHI and the vector P for the NRPS model. Input is the admittance matrix YRED.
- **generateRAPSParameters.m:** File used to calculate the admittance matrix between the output / filters of the VSMs and the matrix to obtain v from e.

### Power calculations

- **getP.m:** File used to calculate the output power of the VSMs / generators
- **getVPQ.m:** File used to calculate the voltage and powers of the VSMs / generators for RAPS and NRPS models

### Execution

- **RungeK.m:** File used for solving a differential equation for a time vector t

### Linearization

- **linearizeFEPS.m:** This file calculates a linear model for the FEPS model

### Model files
